This plugin allows you to implement super security captcha form into web forms. 

== Description ==

The Captcha plugin adds a captcha form into web pages. This captcha can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments forms. It protects your website from spammers by means of math logic, easily understandable by human beings. All you need is to do one of the three basic maths actions - add, subtract and multiply. You will not have to spend your precious time on annoying attempts to understand hard-to-read words, combinations of letters or surreal pictures.
This captcha can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments forms.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to add Captcha Plus to the Contact Form 7. How can I do this? =

1. Make sure you enabled "Contact Form 7" on the Captcha Plus settings page.
2. Go to "Contact Form 7" form where you want to make use of Captcha.
3. For the Contact Form 7 since version 4.2 on the edit form page select the BWS CAPTCHA form-tag, and insert it into your form. For the Contact Form 7 below version 4.2 on the edit form page find a dropdown menu with the form fields, select BWS CAPTCHA and insert it into your form.

= Missing Captcha on the comment form? = 

You might have a theme where comments.php is not coded properly. 

Wordpress version matters. 

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. 
Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the code line `do_action('comment_form'`... inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` (please check the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= Can I move the Captcha block in the comment form? =

It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works (after_comment_field or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call.

Please find the file 'comments.php' in the theme and change position of the line `do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );` or any similar line - place it under the Submit button.
In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

= I would like to add Captcha Plus to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Captcha Plus plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add captcha to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the captcha output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

`if( function_exists( 'cptchpls_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptchpls_display_captcha_custom(); }`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptch_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptch_display_captcha_custom(); } ?>`

5. Then you should add the lines to the function of the entered data checking  

`if( function_exists( 'cptchpls_check_custom_form' ) && cptchpls_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA.";`

or

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptchpls_check_custom_form' ) && cptchpls_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."; ?>`

You could add this line to the variable and display this variable in the required place instead of `echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`. If there is a variable (responsible for the errors output) in the check function, this phrase can be added to this variable. If the function returns 'true', it means that you have entered captcha properly. In all other cases the function will return 'false'.
